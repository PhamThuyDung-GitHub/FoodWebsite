Cloud Computing Concepts: I understand the fundamental principles of cloud computing, including scalability, reliability, and performance, and how to apply them in e-commerce projects to ensure stable and efficient services.

AWS Services Expertise:

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): I have experience in creating, configuring, and managing EC2 instances to host and run applications. This includes selecting the appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type for the applicationâ€™s needs.
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): I have learned how to create a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where I can deploy resources, configure routing tables, subnets, and manage network traffic using security groups and network ACLs.
S3 (Simple Storage Service): I have used S3 for storing product images, catalogs, backups, and static content such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.
CloudWatch: I have experience using CloudWatch to monitor application and infrastructure performance in real-time, setting up alarms and notifications for performance metrics and anomaly detection.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): I understand the principles of IaC and have hands-on experience using tools like AWS CloudFormation to automate infrastructure deployment and resource management.

Security Configuration: I have configured security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound network traffic, ensuring the security of e-commerce platforms. Additionally, I have implemented data encryption and set up IAM policies to manage secure access to AWS services.

Operating System and Web Server Management: I have experience using the command line to manage operating systems on EC2 instances, install necessary software like Apache web servers, and configure appropriate access permissions.

Application Deployment: I have deployed e-commerce applications on EC2 instances, including installing the required software and managing databases to support the application.

Data Transfer and Management: I have transferred data between EC2 instances and S3 buckets, using tools like the AWS CLI and SDKs.

Monitoring and Log Management: I have used CloudWatch and other AWS tools to monitor and manage logs from EC2, S3, and VPC, helping to analyze and identify issues related to performance and security.

Performance Optimization: I have conducted load testing and analyzed performance data to optimize infrastructure, as well as implemented auto-scaling to ensure the application can handle high traffic loads.

AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): I am experienced in using AWS CLI to manage AWS resources, automate tasks such as data backups, and update applications.

Problem Solving: Throughout the deployment process, I have handled issues such as checking directory permissions, configuring IAM roles, and troubleshooting with command-line tools to ensure smooth system operation.
